- error handling for viewing non-index directories 
    - allow forced refresh?
    - what about on actual failure?

- show failure messages on ajax failure
- update failure messages (should they use alerts?)

- strip out parent directories, current directory

- streamline fontello vendoring

- remove bootstrap dependency (probably saves a substantial amount of css)

- add zoom and close buttons
- resize when clicking on edge and holding

- add spinner for ajax requests
