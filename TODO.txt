-. call methods on model passed to template? 

0. strip out parent directories, current directory
1. on error, show red error dialog
2. on bad directory contents, show yellow warnign dialog w/ option to force
3. show progress next to X
4. when inactive, progress should be 'refresh' button
5. add zoom button (fade in/out on mouse movement)
    * fix height, fix width -- zoom in more?
6. remove bootstrap dependency (probably saves a substantial amount of css)
7. set up deployment to dzaman.org

    * amazon ec2 w/ cloudflare on jndex.dzaman.org?

    - can icons be furhter optimized?
        - only load each icon once and just append it to the dom multiple times?
