questions
    - can icons be furhter optimized?
        - only load each icon once and just append it to the dom multiple times?
        - use background images defined once in css?
    - do I need to include the doctype?
        - <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
