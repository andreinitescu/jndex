- error handling for viewing non-index directories 
    - what else is needed?
    - allow forced refresh?
    - what about on actual failure?

- strip out parent directories, current directory

- image placeholders for non-images
- use fonts from fontello
- convert parsing to strategies
- determine navigation flow when clicking on non-folders and non-images

- remove bootstrap dependency (probably saves a substantial amount of css)

- add zoom and close buttons
- resize when clicking on edge and holding

- add spinner for ajax requests

- hide pointer on overlay
